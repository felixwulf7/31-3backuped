# Deep Research Prompt: Integrating Dynamic Games Flask App with Next.js

## Application Context

I've developed a therapeutic game generation app with the following components:

1. **Backend**: Flask API (Python) that uses DeepInfra's LLM API (specifically Llama-2-70b) to generate personalized content
2. **Game Engine**: Static HTML/JavaScript 3D game using Three.js
3. **Workflow**: Users input their struggles, AI generates therapeutic content, and a playable 3D game is created

### Tech Stack Details
- **Server**: Python Flask with Flask-CORS
- **AI Integration**: DeepInfra API (previously Ollama, now cloud-based)
- **Game Files**: Static HTML with embedded JavaScript
- **Storage**: File-based storage of generated games
- **Database**: None currently, files saved to static directory

### Key API Endpoints
- `/generate` - POST request that generates a custom game
- `/api/models` - GET request that returns available AI models
- `/game/<filename>` - GET request that serves generated game files

### File Structure
```

├── debug_games/          # Debug copies of generated games
├── venv/                 # Python virtual environment
├── start_app.sh          # Startup script for macOS/Linux
└── start_app.bat         # Startup script for Windows
```

## Integration Research Goals

I need comprehensive research on integrating this Flask application with my Next.js website. Specifically, I need to understand:

1. **Architectural Options**:
   - How to call Flask API endpoints from Next.js frontend
   - Whether to maintain Flask as a separate service or rewrite functionality
   - Best practices for serving dynamic content generated by Flask

2. **Deployment Strategies**:
   - How to deploy the Flask backend alongside a Next.js app
   - Containerization options (Docker)
   - Serverless deployment possibilities

3. **Authentication & Security**:
   - Securing communication between Next.js and Flask
   - Protecting the DeepInfra API key
   - CORS configuration best practices

4. **User Experience Flow**:
   - How to integrate the game creation form in a Next.js component
   - Loading state management during AI generation
   - Embedding the generated games in the Next.js application

5. **Data Management**:
   - Options for storing generated games (file system vs. database)
   - User session management for generated content
   - Caching strategies for common game themes

6. **Code Examples Needed**:
   - Next.js API route that calls Flask backend
   - React component for game creation form
   - React component for displaying/embedding generated games
   - Configuration for cross-origin requests

7. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Optimizing load times for the generated games
   - Handling AI response latency (3-8 seconds)
   - Progressive loading strategies

## Technical Details for Implementation

The Flask application generates personalized therapeutic games based on user input and stores them as HTML files. A typical workflow:

1. User submits a form with text describing their struggle
2. POST request to `/generate` endpoint
3. Flask calls DeepInfra API with the user input
4. LLM generates game content (title, positive/negative thoughts)
5. Content is injected into a game template HTML file
6. Generated game is saved to `/static` directory
7. URL to the game is returned to the user

The Next.js application needs to integrate this workflow while providing a seamless user experience.

## Cost & Scaling Considerations

- Each game generation costs approximately $0.0015 (less than a fifth of a cent)
- API has rate limits that need to be considered for high traffic
- Games are fairly small HTML files (50-100KB each)

## Question Format

When providing research, please include working code examples in both Python (Flask) and JavaScript/TypeScript (Next.js) specifically tailored to this integration task. Focus on practical implementation details rather than general theory.

## Additional Context

The therapeutic nature of this application has user privacy implications that should be considered in recommendations.
