# Deep Research Prompts for Dynamic Therapeutic Games

This directory contains detailed prompts for conducting deep research on various aspects of the therapeutic games application. Each prompt is designed to help you understand specific integration, enhancement, or optimization opportunities for the project.

## Available Prompts

### 1. Next.js Integration
**Filename:** [`nextjs_integration_prompt.md`](./nextjs_integration_prompt.md)

This prompt helps you research how to effectively integrate the Flask-based dynamic games application with a Next.js frontend. It covers architectural options, deployment strategies, authentication, user experience flow, data management, and performance considerations.

### 2. Monetization Strategies
**Filename:** [`monetization_strategy_prompt.md`](./monetization_strategy_prompt.md)

This prompt guides research on viable monetization approaches for the therapeutic game application. It covers pricing models, implementation requirements, market analysis, B2B/B2C opportunities, ethical considerations, revenue projections, and technical implementation details.

### 3. UX and Gamification Enhancements
**Filename:** [`ux_gamification_prompt.md`](./ux_gamification_prompt.md)

This prompt explores how to enhance user experience and gamification elements. It covers therapeutic gamification best practices, UX enhancements, game mechanics expansion, personalization opportunities, engagement strategies, technical implementation, and effectiveness measurement.

### 4. AI Model Optimization
**Filename:** [`ai_optimization_prompt.md`](./ai_optimization_prompt.md)

This prompt examines ways to optimize the AI model usage and improve prompt engineering. It covers model selection, prompt engineering improvements, API integration optimization, content enhancement techniques, specialized fine-tuning potential, multi-model architecture, and technical implementation details.

### 5. Security and Privacy
**Filename:** [`security_privacy_prompt.md`](./security_privacy_prompt.md)

This prompt focuses on security and privacy best practices for a mental health application. It covers regulatory compliance, user data protection, technical security implementation, third-party risk management, privacy by design, threat modeling, and technical implementation details.

## How to Use These Prompts

These prompts are designed to be used with AI research assistants or for structuring your own research process. To make the most of them:

1. **Choose the most relevant prompt** for your current development focus
2. **Copy the entire prompt** including all sections and context
3. **Submit to an AI research assistant** or use as a framework for your own research
4. **Refine the results** to fit your specific implementation needs
5. **Implement recommended changes** to the dynamic games application

Each prompt is self-contained with detailed context about the application, specific research goals, and technical implementation questions to ensure you get practical, actionable results.

## Extending the Prompts

Feel free to modify these prompts to better suit your specific needs. You might want to:

- Add more specific technical details about your implementation
- Focus on particular aspects of each research area
- Combine elements from multiple prompts for a more holistic approach
- Add specific requirements or constraints based on your development environment
